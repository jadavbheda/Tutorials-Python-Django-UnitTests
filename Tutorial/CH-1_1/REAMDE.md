# unittest framework
* unittest has been built into the Python standard library since version 2.1. Youâ€™ll probably see it in commercial Python applications and open-source projects.

* unittest contains both a testing framework and a test runner. unittest has some important requirements for writing and executing tests.

* unittest requires that:
    * You put your tests into classes as methods
    * You use a series of special assertion methods in the unittest.TestCase class instead of the built-in assert statement
    * To convert the earlier example to a unittest test case, you would have to:
        * Import unittest from the standard library
        * Create a class called TestSum that inherits from the TestCase class
        * Convert the test functions into methods by adding self as the first argument
        * Change the assertions to use the self.assertEqual() method on the TestCase class
        * Change the command-line entry point to call unittest.main() OR run with -m unittest

## How to run unittests?
> python test_sum_unittest.py
> python -m unittest test_sum_unittest_runner.py [Preferred]
