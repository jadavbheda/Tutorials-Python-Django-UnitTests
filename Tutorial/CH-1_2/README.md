# pytest framework
* Pytest expects our tests to be located in files whose names begin with test_ or end with _test.py.
* pytest supports execution of unittest test cases. The real advantage of pytest comes by writing pytest test cases. pytest test cases are a series of functions in a Python file starting with the name test_.

* pytest has some other great features:
    * compatible with unittest
    * Support for the built-in assert statement instead of using special self.assert*() methods
    * Support for filtering for test cases
    * Ability to rerun from the last failing test
    * An ecosystem of hundreds of plugins to extend the functionality
